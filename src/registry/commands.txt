htpasswd -cB htpasswd {username}
# Then write whichever password you want

# Copy the line from the htpasswd file into config/htpasswd
# If you change the password the runner gives to the pipeline, run the following command
echo {username}:{password} | base64
# and copy it into the config/config.json file as the "auth" element
# This file is given to the runner, and allows the pipelines to access the registry
